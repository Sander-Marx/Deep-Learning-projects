Deliverables include
- Jupyter notebook
- Report
- Folder with figures from task 2.1.6

We include the folder with figures so that the figures can be rendered in the jupyter notebook.

We deliver the files in a zip file as well as delivering the report and notebook separately to make sure all the deliveries are in order.
